Final project for Computer Organization Course (CSCI 237):
An emulator for a WARM, ARM-like RISC processor, written in WIND, a Intel x86 assembly-like language.
Given a WARM program, the wave3.s program loads the WARM program into memory and runs the program, simulating
its execution on a WARM processor.
